function [] = checkGaussian_Pulse(atomdata)
% the purpose of this function is to check how good the gaussian pulses are
% in a given atomdata. The reason we want to check is potentially the
% amplifier might have some non-linearity at high RF strengths that leads
% to the pulses being mis-shaped. 

%make sure to get the right V0 and vva values
